# Some helpful things I use in engineering practice.
There are only `C++` implementations right now.

There are usage examples for most of implemented structures. 

It is not guranted that this structures`s implementation is optimally, but most of them were used in practice and work good.

# Primitives
Primitives contains some useful structures not included in STL yet. For example, there is lightweight function reference class.
